# Liquiscrape

This is a testing repository to scrape data from Liquipedia.

This repo scrapes LoL players and creates three files:

**names.json**: Scraped data from each LoL player.

**team.json**: Organizes players in their respective team rosters.

**names.txt**: just a txt file with nick names.

All of this data can be really useful in eSports Manager.

At one point I plan on introducing more data to each file, making it more compatible with eSM, and eSM will be able to generate a lot of things from these files.

## Running

There is some confusion in these files.

Run `main.py` to get the players.

`main_team.py` extracts team data from each table, along with players in the current roster with their real names.

`attempt.py` uses the files generated in `main.py` to generate the `teams.json`.

`try_teams.py` is an alternative way to get team names from one of the liquipedia pages, it only gets team names, but the advantage is that it gets their region as well.
